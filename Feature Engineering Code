# creating a dataframe that groups the rows by date, and making the TOTAL SUM for each Day. 
df_name = df.groupby('Date').agg({'Profit': 'sum'}) 

# creating a Moving Average (TimeSeries Predictions)
df_name['moving_avg'] = daily_df['Profit'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Creating Binned Labels 
bins = [0, 50,150,280]
labels = [1,2,3]
df_name['binned_values'] = pd.cut(daily_df['Profit'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

#Creating Lag Periods
df_name['Profit_lag_1'] = daily_df['Profit'].shift(periods=1)
